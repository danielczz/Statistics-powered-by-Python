## Project outline

It is a typical scenario to analyze data with a different approach. Depending on the needs and scenario, statistical tools could be very useful in order to get a better understanding on the data.

That's what we are going to do here, analyze data with statistical tools... powered by **Python**.

The main attributes of this particular information and data providers is that are _real-time data providers_, and we are going to use _Web scrapping tools_ in order to obtain a best of breed web application in real-time to understand Mars current behavior.

The direct links for the different assets for the analysis are as follows:
